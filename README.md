# Team Super Slack Bros - Final Project

A two week group project to build a game in Python using Pygame

* Our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/mXUdQOWW/final-project-team-super-slack-bros)

I would like to be able to collide with the walls 

As a user 
So I know how big the game world is 
I would like there to be only one room

As a game dev 
So I know I bumped into the wall
I would like to be able to see the collision in the console
